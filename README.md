# xcore

The universal IO coupler

## Introduction
X-CORE is the bridge between anything, anywhere. The X at the beginning of the name is more algebraic meaning ‘any’. At present X could mean your smart phone and the lightbulbs in your house and in the future it could be your eye phone and your flying car. The problem with technology today is that we have lots of it but it doesn’t comunicate together well, we hope to change this.
